## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) to evoke trust and efficiency, as blue is often associated with professionalism and clarity.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), a very pale tint of the primary hue. This is a friendly, gentle, light background that does not distract the user.
- Accent color: A contrasting vibrant green (#34A853), to highlight successful booking confirmations, key CTAs, and available slots. It is analogous to blue, evoking feelings of security.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined, objective and neutral look. It is very suitable for body text as well.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent cafeteria seats, meeting rooms, and booking actions.
- Implement a grid-based layout for clear information hierarchy and easy navigation.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as loading indicators and confirmation animations.
